# Tagging Modes of transport
This R Shiny application lets you quickliy label mode of transport of trips recorded by utrail-devices. 
It requires at least one file with Accelerometer information and one file with GPS information (including speed).
The application will then visualise location, speed and acceleration and offer a reasonably intuitive GUI to label the trips.
In the end, the files will be merged and made available for download.
The error messages will disappear as soon as the data is uploaded.
